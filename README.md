# Sudoku-Puzzle-GUI
Used Python to build an image display GUI that displays the image files in any folder of the userâ€™s computer. Allows the user to cycle through the images using, arrow keys, button press, or clicking on the file name from a table, and to navigate to other folders by typing in the path to that folder.
